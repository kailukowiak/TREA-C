# Pre-Training Infrastructure Status Report

## 🎯 Current Status

### ✅ What We Built Successfully

#### **Core Infrastructure**
- **Multi-Dataset Loader** (`duet/data/multi_dataset_loader.py`)
  - Unified schema handling across different datasets
  - Balanced sampling with feature padding and masking
  - Custom collate function for mixed data types
  - Dynamic feature space unification (handles 6-12 features across datasets)

#### **Self-Supervised Learning Framework**
- **SSL Objectives** (`duet/models/ssl_objectives.py`)
  - **Masked Patch Prediction**: BERT-like masking for time series patches
  - **Temporal Order Prediction**: Learning temporal dependencies through sequence shuffling
  - **Contrastive Learning**: Cross-domain representation learning with data augmentation

#### **Pre-Training Model**
- **PretrainPatchDuET** (`duet/models/pretrain_patch_duet.py`)
  - Extended VariableFeaturePatchDuET with SSL heads
  - Combined SSL + supervised training capability
  - `from_pretrained()` method for fine-tuning
  - Handles variable feature counts across datasets (7→12 features)

#### **Training Scripts**
- **Pre-training script** (`scripts/pretrain.py`): Multi-dataset SSL training
- **Fine-tuning script** (`scripts/finetune.py`): Task-specific adaptation
- **Evaluation script** (`scripts/evaluate_pretraining.py`): Performance comparison framework

#### **Dataset Integration**
Successfully integrated 4 diverse time series datasets:
- **ETTh1**: 7 features, 3 classes, electricity transformer data
- **Human Activity**: 6 features, 6 classes, sensor data
- **Air Quality**: 10 features, 3 classes, environmental monitoring
- **Financial Market**: 12 features, 3 classes, market analysis

### ❌ Current Blocker

#### **NaN Loss Values During Training**
- **Symptom**: Loss becomes NaN within first few hundred iterations
- **Scope**: Affects even simplified configurations (single SSL objective, small models)
- **Persistence**: Occurs across different:
  - Batch sizes (4-8)
  - Learning rates (1e-5 to 1e-3) 
  - Model sizes (32-128 d_model)
  - Precision settings (16-bit, 32-bit)

#### **Investigation Results**
- ✅ **Unit tests pass**: Small synthetic data works fine
- ✅ **Model architecture**: No dimensional mismatches after fixes
- ❌ **Real dataset training**: NaN appears with actual datasets
- ❌ **All SSL objectives affected**: Even masked patch prediction alone fails

## 🔍 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### **1. Debug the NaN Issue** ⚡ *HIGH PRIORITY*

#### **Suspected Root Causes**
- **Data preprocessing issues**: 
  - NaN handling in padded feature regions
  - Value ranges in real datasets causing numerical instability
  - Feature normalization problems
  
- **Loss computation numerical instability**:
  - MSE loss on patch reconstructions
  - Gradient explosion through transformer layers
  - SSL loss scaling interactions

- **Training dynamics**:
  - Mixed precision arithmetic issues
  - Dynamic layer creation in temporal order prediction
  - Feature mask interactions with loss computation

#### **Debugging Strategy**
1. **Data audit**: Check value ranges, NaN distributions, feature statistics
2. **Loss component isolation**: Test each SSL loss independently
3. **Gradient analysis**: Monitor gradient norms and flows
4. **Minimal reproduction**: Strip down to absolute minimum working case

### **2. Stabilize Training** 🛠️ *MEDIUM PRIORITY*

#### **Option A: Start Simple**
- Begin with supervised-only training (no SSL)
- Ensure base VariableFeaturePatchDuET works on multi-dataset
- Add SSL objectives one by one

#### **Option B: Alternative SSL Objectives**
- Replace problematic objectives with simpler ones:
  - Next-patch prediction instead of temporal order
  - SimCLR-style contrastive learning
  - Autoencoder reconstruction

#### **Option C: Enhanced Numerical Safeguards**
- Better gradient clipping and loss scaling
- Input normalization and regularization
- Robust loss functions (Huber loss instead of MSE)

### **3. Alternative Implementation Paths** 🔄 *LOW PRIORITY*

#### **Single Dataset Pre-training**
- Start with just ETTh1 dataset
- Prove SSL objectives work in isolation
- Scale up to multi-dataset gradually

#### **Baseline Comparison**
- Implement standard PatchTST without variable features
- Compare against our variable feature approach
- Validate architectural choices

#### **Simplified Multi-dataset**
- Use feature truncation instead of padding
- Start with datasets of similar feature counts
- Reduce schema complexity

### **4. Full Evaluation Pipeline** 🚀 *FUTURE*

#### **Once Training is Stable**
- **Scale up**: Full multi-dataset pre-training (50+ epochs)
- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Pre-trained vs from-scratch across all datasets
- **Fine-tuning experiments**: Different freezing strategies, learning rates
- **Ablation studies**: Individual SSL objective contributions

#### **Research Questions to Answer**
- How much does pre-training improve sample efficiency?
- Which SSL objectives contribute most to transfer learning?
- How does variable feature handling affect performance?
- What's the optimal pre-training dataset mix?
